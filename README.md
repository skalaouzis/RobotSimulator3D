# RobotSimulator3D

Software robot simulators not only simplify development work for robotics engineers, but they also give researchers a tool for studying artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and machine learning. One such research-focused simulator is the open source Simbad project, built on Java 3D technology. This article shows how to program virtual robots using the Simbad toolkit to realize the robotics-design philosophy of subsumption architecture.
